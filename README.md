In this study, we report an overview of human databases with web applications, in twelve major topics:

Alternative splicing,
Cancer databases,
Comparative databases,
Disease-specific,
Gene expression,
Genomic and sequence,
lncRNA and miRNA,
Metabolic and enzyme,
Methylation,
Proteome and protein-protein interaction,
Regulatory elements,
Other specialized databases (which comprise immunogenetic databases, genome-wide databases, rare disease databases, and other human tools and databases).
Our goal is to provide an opportunity for exploring large datasets and analyzing the data for users with little or no programming skills. Public user-friendly web-based databases facilitate data mining and the search for information applicable to healthcare professionals.

We analyzed databases and tools retrieved from Omictools and Bio.tools

Enjoy our work! :D
