## Step 1 Discovering the ACE2 gene

First of all, we use OMIM <https://omim.org/> to found more informations abou the *ACE2* gene. 

Using the OMIM database, we found:
  - [x] **Alternative gene name**: (*ACEH*)
  - [X] **HGNC Approved Gene Symbol**: *ACE2*
  - [X] **Cytogenetic location**: Xp22.2
  - [X] **Genomic coordinates** (GRCh38): X:15,518,196-15,602,157 (retrieved from NCBI).

  Also, OMIM provides information about **Cloning and Expression**, **Gene Structure**, **Mapping**, **Gene Function**, **Biochemical Features**, **Molecular Genetics**, **Animal Model** information, and **REFERENCES** related to the gene.

Using GeneCards <https://www.genecards.org/>, we found several topics about the *ACE2* gene:

* Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 and aliases for *ACE2* Gene
* External Ids for ACE2 Gene and Previous GeneCards Identifiers for *ACE2* Gene
* Summaries for *ACE2* Gene: Entrez, GeneCards, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, and Gene Wiki Gene Summary for *ACE2* Gene
* Genomics: promoters and enhancers, gene orientation and RefSeq
* Protein information, with antibody and protein products
* Domains
* Molecular function, gene ontology and animal models for *ACE2*
* Related drugs
* Transcripts
* Expression for *ACE2* Gene
* Orthologs, Paralogs, Disorders and Variants for *ACE2* Gene
* Publications, Products and Sources.
